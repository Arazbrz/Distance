# Distance

First Step: add 3phase ct, vt signals of the two ends of a line and relay will automatically calculate the line Z1, Z2, and Z0, and therefore, the zones are automatically adjusted based on standard.
Sceond Step: Adjust Criteria for the tripping (How many samples in the zone will trip?)
Third Step: Add fault 3 phase voltage and current signals and run the code.

The trajectory and the trip signal will be plotted.
